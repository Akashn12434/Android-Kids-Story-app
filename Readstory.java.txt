He searched high and low, but couldn’t find something that he could eat. Finally, as his
stomach rumbled he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall he saw the biggest
juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready
to be eaten.To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened
his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.He
tried a few more times but kept failing.Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go
home. While he walked away he muttered, i am sure the grapes were sour anyway.");

starving grasshopper came up. With his fiddle under his arm, the grasshopper humbly begged
for a bite to eat.What!” cried the ants, “Haven’t you stored any food away for the winter?
What in the world were you doing all summer?”I didn’t have time to store any food before
winter,” the grasshopper whined. “I was too busy making music that the summer flew
by.”The ants simply shrugged their shoulders and said, “Making music, were you? Very well,
now dance!” The ants then turned their backs on the grasshopper and returned to work\".");

chasing the sheep!” When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive
the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing
their angry faces. Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!”
They angrily went back down the hill.Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf!
Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came
running up the hill to scare the wolf away.As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly,
“Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no
wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once
more.Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his
feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling
them again, and so they didn’t come to help.At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy
who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him
weeping.“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t
come,” he wailed.An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said,
“Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth");

soon saw a monkey and proceeded to ask, ‘Can we be friends, monkey?’The monkey quickly

the elephant continued to search when it stumbled across a rabbit. She proceeded to ask him,
‘Can we be friends, rabbit?’ The rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, “You are too big to
fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend.”Then, the elephant continued until she met a
frog. She asked, “Will you be my friend, frog?”The frog replied, “You are too big and heavy;
you cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you can’t be my friend.”The elephant continued to
ask the animals she met on her way, but always received the same reply. The following day,
the elephant saw all the forest animals run in fear. She stopped a bear to ask what was
happening and was told the tiger was attacking all the small animals.The elephant wanted to
save the other animals, so she went to the tiger and said, “Please, sir, leave my friends alone.
Do not eat them.”The tiger didn’t listen. He merely told the elephant to mind her own
business.Seeing no other way, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared him away. Upon
hearing of the brave tale, the other animals agreed, “You are just the right size to be our
friend");

farmer thought to himself, “Why should we take just one egg a day? Why can’t we take them
all at once and make a lot of money?” The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly
agreed.Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp
knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs.
But, as he opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood.The farmer
quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource. As the days
went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer. How jinxed and how foolish they
